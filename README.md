SimpleQ is a web app primarily for teachers that allows them to generate study tools for the use of their students. Users have the ability to create a quiz or study guide though three templates. Inspired by the need to be able to create such content without headache as opposed to features offered by board of education software. Those who wish to take a quiz can simply access the full list of quizzes or search by the author. All results are emailed to the quiz author.
